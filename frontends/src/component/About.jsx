        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
          At <strong>Pet Shelter</strong>, we believe every animal deserves a second chance at life filled with love, care, and comfort.
          Founded with compassion at its core, we rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome abandoned, injured, or stray animals.
          Our shelter is more than just a refugeâ€”it's a stepping stone to a better life for hundreds of animals each year.
        </p>
